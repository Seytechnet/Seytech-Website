Being that the freelancer is a solo worker, they will be in direct contact with you which simplifies communication and enables you to stay involved in the creative process. You can monitor progress through milestones and provide direct feedback. A single worker also has lower overhead than an agency which often results in better pricing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, working with just one person can have its drawbacks- no matter how good they are! For one, if they get sick, overwhelmed, or have other difficulties, it will cause delays in your project because there is no one else who can pick up the slack.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another factor to consider is that the freelancer may be an expert in certain areas, but not others. This can leave you needing to hire and manage multiple freelancers to complete a project, a sizeable task in itself. Additionally, finding a good freelancer takes time and possibly a few tries. The person not only needs to have the right skill set but also must have good communication and a strong work ethic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In summary, here&#8217;s a look at the pros and cons:<\/p>\n<p><b>Pros<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Direct contact enables a high-level of involvement<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specialized expert in the particular field<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost-effective pricing<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Cons<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limited bandwidth&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Often expertise is limited to select areas<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No back up if the person gets sick or becomes unavailable<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work overload can affect performance<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing multiple freelancers can be difficult <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Requires careful vetting<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Option 2: Hire an Agency<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-638\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/annie-spratt-604131-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"6154\" height=\"4216\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/annie-spratt-604131-unsplash.jpg 6154w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/annie-spratt-604131-unsplash-300x206.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/annie-spratt-604131-unsplash-768x526.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/annie-spratt-604131-unsplash-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/annie-spratt-604131-unsplash-1080x740.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/annie-spratt-604131-unsplash-610x418.jpg 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/annie-spratt-604131-unsplash-600x411.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6154px) 100vw, 6154px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you hire an agency, you get a team of experts rather than just one person. As a result, you gain access to a set of skills and knowledge, more bandwidth, and greater resources. Further, the individuals within the agency have experience working together to complete projects successfully. As a result, agencies can typically handle multi-faceted projects that freelancers can\u2019t, and in a shorter amount of time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the nature of having more than one person on board, it&#8217;s much less likely that your project will get delayed due to something like an illness or overbooking. Agencies also have a reputation to upkeep for the success of everyone on the team, therefore, there\u2019s more on the line if they don\u2019t complete your project to your standards. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The downside is that they are often more expensive than freelancers due to the increased overhead. Additionally, with multiple people working, there is often a project manager in place which can provide a barrier between you and the person working on your project. This can result in a more hands-off process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So here are the pros and cons:<\/p>\n<p><b>Pros<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wider skillset<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More stability<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better accountability\/dependability<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can work faster <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can handle larger projects<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Cons<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More expensive<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indirect communication<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Let&#8217;s Recap: Freelancer or Agency<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-681\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Freelancer-vs-agency-table.png\" alt=\"Freelancer vs. Agency Comparison Table\" width=\"1270\" height=\"1138\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Freelancer-vs-agency-table.png 1270w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Freelancer-vs-agency-table-300x269.png 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Freelancer-vs-agency-table-768x688.png 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Freelancer-vs-agency-table-1024x918.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Freelancer-vs-agency-table-1080x968.png 1080w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Freelancer-vs-agency-table-610x547.png 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Freelancer-vs-agency-table-600x538.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So which is better?

If you have a one-off project and find a great freelancer that comes highly recommended, they may be able get your project done perfectly and at a fraction of the cost you\u2019d pay an agency. However, you are taking on some risk by going that route and face limitations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need to achieve many goals, an agency will come at a higher cost but can offer more bandwidth and a wider range of skills.
