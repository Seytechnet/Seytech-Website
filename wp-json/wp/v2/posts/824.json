However, implementation grew significantly between 2007 and 2012, jumping from 34.8% to 71%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why? During George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, the healthcare IT budget was doubled, a National Health Information Coordinator sub-cabinet position was created, and an industry-wide mandate was issued requiring healthcare professionals to adopt electronic health record systems by 2014.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obama supported this initiative as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The ARRA gave additional funding and incentives to healthcare professionals that adopted the EHR systems by 2014. It also charged penalties to those who failed to do so. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do EHR systems do? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EHR systems enable healthcare professionals such as nurses, technicians, medical assistants, and coding professionals to electronically record patient data instead of keeping physical records on paper. This can include a patient\u2019s vital signs, weight, test results, conditions, allergies, procedures, immunizations, and more. Additionally, the EHR is used for administration tasks like scheduling appointments, submitting medical claims, and updating patient records with diagnostic codes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why the push for EHR systems? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These systems make it easier for medical professionals to view a person\u2019s medical history in full. They have access to more information which can help them to better diagnose problems while helping to reduce the likelihood of mistakes. The systems also help to optimize administrative work flows while lowering the costs.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At large, clinical researchers can use the patient data to gain important insights about public health such as early detection of a viral or bacterial outbreak.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telemedicine<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-827\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-340966-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"6000\" height=\"3717\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-340966-unsplash.jpg 6000w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-340966-unsplash-300x186.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-340966-unsplash-768x476.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-340966-unsplash-1024x634.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-340966-unsplash-1080x669.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-340966-unsplash-610x378.jpg 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-340966-unsplash-600x372.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up is telemedicine. As the use of smartphones has become the norm in the U.S., two-way video consultations between patients and health care providers have also entered the mainstream. Using a smartphone or computer, a patient can video chat with a healthcare professional without leaving the comfort of their home. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MDLive, for example, enables virtual visits with doctors, counselors, psychiatrists, or dermatologists by phone, video, or mobile app. The medical professionals can monitor symptoms and vital signs remotely and can even send a prescription to your local pharmacy if medically necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps to alleviate the inconveniences and risks that come with traveling to the doctor&#8217;s office and waiting with other sick patients. Further, it has led to savings for patients and healthcare providers, while improving access to patients in rural areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mhealth (Mobile health)<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-832\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/crew-22256-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4896\" height=\"3264\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/crew-22256-unsplash.jpg 4896w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/crew-22256-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/crew-22256-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/crew-22256-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/crew-22256-unsplash-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/crew-22256-unsplash-610x407.jpg 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/crew-22256-unsplash-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4896px) 100vw, 4896px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mhealth is the coined term for mobile health and it encompasses all mobile apps designed for healthcare purposes such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patient education<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decision support<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthcare provider tools<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearable sensors and point-of-care diagnostics<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electronic health records<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthcare management<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disease and population registries<\/span><\/li>\n<li>And more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2016, there were <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ticbiomed.org\/2016\/10\/13\/the-mhealth-app-market-is-getting-crowded-reaching-the-259-000-apps\/https:\/\/www.ticbiomed.org\/2016\/10\/13\/the-mhealth-app-market-is-getting-crowded-reaching-the-259-000-apps\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">259,000 mHealth apps&nbsp;<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on the market.

On June 4, 2018, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2018\/06\/apple-opens-health-records-api-to-developers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> delivered a Health Records API for developers and researchers which lets users share their health record data with apps. Patients of over 500 hospitals and clinics will be able to access medical information through apps on their iPhone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The health records data will be encrypted and protected by the user\u2019s passcode. Consumers can opt to share their health record data with the third-party apps they choose. The data will flow from the HealthKit to the third-party app, never crossing Apple\u2019s servers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What kind of apps will utilize this information?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Medication management<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A medication management app connects with the health records feature so prescription lists can be imported. Warnings will be triggered for problematic drug-drug interactions. Further, the app will feature pill reminders and information about relevant medications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Nutrition planning<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A nutrition planning app will help you plan your meals based on your medical needs (i.e., low salt, high fiber, etc.).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Medical research:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When patients agree to share their medical history through the app, medical researchers can use the data to perform more comprehensive research than they are able to do through patient surveys.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Disease management<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Apps for specific diseases like diabetes will help patients to track their lab results and diet and exercise details (using the iOS HealthKit integration). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The possibilities are far-reaching. It\u2019s in the hands of developers, visionaries, and entrepreneurs to create apps that will utilize the user\u2019s health records in a way that is most useful to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3D printing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in July, a team of surgeons at the Rashid Hospital in the UAE practiced a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dha.gov.ae\/en\/dhanews\/pages\/dhanews1036307583-12-07-2017.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">complicated surgical procedure<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a 3D-printed model in which they placated four veins in a 60-year old.

While EHR helped to optimize patient data and medical office procedures, mHealth, 3D printing, AI, and telemedicine hold the potential to deliver us to a very different world ten years from now. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One in which you don\u2019t go to the doctor\u2019s office nearly as often because you can reach him or her through your smartphone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where a robot performs your next surgery.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, where you can use apps and your official health records to monitor your vitals, manage your own disease, and take a driver&#8217;s seat in your health management (with a doctor on-hand anytime). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The future of medicine is one that uses technology to empower the patient, who for many years, was completely at the mercy of their provider. Further, it is one in which advanced systems help to solve our health woes with greater accuracy and lower costs.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovate with Brightscout<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-828\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-472352-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5915\" height=\"3947\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-472352-unsplash.jpg 5915w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-472352-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-472352-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-472352-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-472352-unsplash-1080x721.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-472352-unsplash-610x407.jpg 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/rawpixel-472352-unsplash-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5915px) 100vw, 5915px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have an idea for the healthcare industry that could help providers or patients?
