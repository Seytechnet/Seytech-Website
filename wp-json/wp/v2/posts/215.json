Data and innovative technology is increasingly available which has created a new opportunity, and expectation, for enterprises to work smarter and faster.

It went from 0 users in April of 2014, to 6 million daily active users and 2 million paid users by September of 2017. There is no doubt it identified a need for a new method of communication; e-mail just wasn\u2019t cutting it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack brings all of a team\u2019s communication together in one place, organizing conversations and making them accessible. You can search past conversations to find relevant information that you need. Further, you can integrate existing productivity products or build your own with Slack\u2019s open API. However, all of the customization for Slack is added on top of the existing platform. It is an afterthought, resulting in superficial functionality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hipchat is another notable messaging platform created by Atlassian. It actually predated Slack, launching in 2010. However, it didn\u2019t take off in the same way. One source says it only grew to 90,000 active users. This year Atlassian launched Stride with several new features such as task creation\/assignment and audio\/video chat. While these changes may help to improve the ability for people to work together, not at an integral level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack, Hipchat, and several other platforms (Twist, Microsoft\u2019s Teams, Discord) all have some basic features, bots, and plugins for work, but they don\u2019t offer deep configurability. The result is that teams have to use multiple tools and platforms to get work done which takes longer and is less effective.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_207\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-207\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-207\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/competitor-graphic-1024x728.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"728\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-207\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Top group messaging solutions<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Data Problem<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to IDC\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.emc.com\/leadership\/digital-universe\/2014iview\/index.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital Universe report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, by 2020, the amount of information that will be stored in the world\u2019s IT systems is enough to fill a stack of tablets that reaches from the earth to the moon 6.6 times and 85% of that will belong to enteprises. Enterprises hope to use the data to decrease expenses through operational effiicencies, establish a more data-driven culture, and create new avenues for disruption and innovation, according to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/newvantage.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Big-Data-Executive-Survey-2017-Executive-Summary.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NewVantage survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Instead of team members having to go out and find the important information and relay it or find a third-party plug-in, it will always be present, available, and deeply integrated into the work flow. This can not only save time but help all parties to make better decisions. The result? A new level of unprecedented productivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_214\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-214\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-214 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Notes-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-214\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Take long form notes on your conversation and share with other.<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Future of Group Messaging and Death of Email<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next generation of group messaging could, dare we say it, make email almost obsolete. Users will be able to communicate with their teams, and using unique identifiers like an email address, can reach external contacts as well. They will be able to organize personal contacts separate from their teams, gaining the ability to live chat with anyone, anytime. Global live chat has the potential to change how businesses communicate in the same way that texting changed how we communicate with our friends and family. It will be more efficient and convenient. Especially, for certain types of short messages that don\u2019t make sense for email.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_215\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-215\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-215 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Profile-Email-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-215\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Combine email and messaging under one platform.<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About Brightscout<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Composed of an elite team of technologists and idea-makers, Brightscout is a leader in emerging and disruptive technologies.
