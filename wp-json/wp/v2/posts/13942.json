Our team prepared several variations based on the messaging they wanted to deliver and their target audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the client decided on the final logo design, we went ahead and created a collection of assets that incorporated the logo, colors, and other design elements. All of which were created based on the guidelines provided by the client.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team took these directives to heart as we needed to make the best impression possible, and the fastest way to do that was getting as much of the project right on the first try. This effort seems to work as it resulted in this great review with a good score.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/topdesignfirms.com\/ux-design\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a notable project<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in more ways than one because it\u2019s allowed our inclusion in the top 100 UX Designers list of another B2B platform &#8211; Top Design Firms. This puts our team in a great position coming into 2022 and will give us great leverage for new projects as the months unfold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope that this review is the starting point for a new lead stream for us and that we meet many new clients because of it.
