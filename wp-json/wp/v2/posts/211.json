According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/gx\/en\/industries\/financial-services\/assets\/pwc-global-fintech-report-2017.pdf\">2017 Global FinTech Report<\/a> by PwC, 55% of respondents in the financial services sector expect to adopt blockchain as part of an in-production system or process by 2018 and 77% by 2020.

Cryptopay<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-874\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/fb_cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3280\" height=\"1688\"><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cryptopay.me\/\"> Cryptopay<\/a> offers a mobile application (available in the App Store and Google Play Store) that enables users to easily manage their bitcoins. You can convert them into US dollars, Euros, or British Pounds, send them to friends, and get a prepaid debit card so you can withdraw money from ATMs and use it to make purchases.<\/p>\n<p>The card serves as a much-needed connection between Bitcoin and traditional finances and is accepted alongside all major credit cards. Further, the ability to convert your bitcoins enables you to secure your money against fluctuations in the market.<\/p>\n<p>As of this writing, Cryptopay has 598,577 active users and has issued 112,549 prepaid cards.<\/p>\n<h3>2. LAToken<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-875\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/latoken-main-banner2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1176\" height=\"480\"><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/latoken.com\/\">LAToken<\/a> is crypto trading platform that enables you to trade bitcoins on a global scale, tokenize and sell your assets, list your token, and make an initial coin offering (ICO) out of your project. Its main function is to serve as a bridge between the real and crypto economy, enabling real assets to be traded in crypto.<\/p>\n<p>The way it works for tokenizing assets such as commodities, art, debt, equity, or real estate is asset owners sell part of the asset to a custodian certified by LAToken. The custodian then provides asset tokens equivalent to the value of the assets. Those are then sold to cryptoholders. (Note: You can also opt to be the cryptoholder buying tokens linked to real assets.) The cryptoholders may then sell the tokens on a secondary market. A settlement date is set on which the asset owner buys back the asset tokens, or the token holders receive the proceeds from the custodian selling the asset at a flat auction.<\/p>\n<p>As for the trading side, crypto holders can buy asset tokens at an auction on the platform which are connected to publicly traded assets. On the settlement date, LAToken will buy back the asset tokens at the current market price of the asset.<\/p>\n<p>Because crypto holders buy LAT to purchase asset tokens and pay for transactions, the demand is correlated with the LAT Platform trading volume. Currently, LAToken\u2019s global asset value sits at $517 trillion while their global trading volume is at $155 trillion.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Abra<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-877\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Abra-and-Amex-join-forces-with-bitcoin-final_revised-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"4662\" height=\"3297\"><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.abra.com\/\">Abra<\/a> is another mobile app, and it allows you to easily buy and sell Bitcoin as well as send and store it.
