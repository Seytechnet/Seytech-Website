Gone are the days when you had to reach customers through mail, billboards, television, or even a desktop computer. Smartphones open a direct line of communication.<\/p>\n<p>However, the road to a smooth mobile experience has been a bit rocky. Further, customers aren&#8217;t very tolerant of a poor UX. In fact, eight out of 10 will stop engaging with content when it doesn&#8217;t display well on their device and most won&#8217;t wait more than a few seconds for a page to load before clicking &#8216;back.&#8217;<\/p>\n<h4>When a mobile experience goes awry, businesses miss out.<\/h4>\n<p>The latest solution is the&nbsp;progressive web app (PWA). It&#8217;s helping businesses, including industry leaders like Pinterest and Forbes, to provide their customers with the seamless mobile experience they demand. Unsurprisingly, positive business results are following close behind.<\/p>\n<p>For the unacquainted and those who want to learn more, here&#8217;s a closer look at the ins and outs of progressive web apps.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are progressive web apps?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Progressive web apps combine the features of modern web browsers and mobile experiences to offer the best of both. They can appear like a native mobile app or traditional application but are actually regular web pages. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Google Chrome engineer, Alex Russell, who coined the term \u2018progressive web app,\u2019 the technical baseline criteria that qualifies a site to be considered a PWA includes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of service workers which allow a site to load while it is offline <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">References to a web page manifest with at least the following four key properties: name, short_name, display, and start_url<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Origination from a secure origin and served over TLS and green padlock displays without active mixed content<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Displaying of an icon (minimum of 144 x 144) in png format<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this basic definition in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at where progressive apps came from, the tech behind them, and why industry leaders are adopting them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The events leading up to progressive web apps<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PWAs are the result of an evolution of web development technologies. Here are some highlights over the past decade or so:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>2005<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Web development tech began to shift from static to dynamic documents which were enabled by client-side tools, server tools, and responsive web design. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>2007<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The iPhone pushed for web-based apps based on dynamic technologies but failed in comparison to native apps<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>2010-2015<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Technology enhancements in Javascript, CSS#, HTML5, web browsers, and processors enabled hybrid apps as a viable alternative<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>2015<\/strong>: Google updated its algorithm to favor mobile-friendly websites<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>2015<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Frances Berriman and Alex Russell coined the term progressive web apps to describe apps that take advantage of features in modern browsers (such as web app manifests and service workers) and let users upgrade web apps to PWAs in their native operating system. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>2018<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: PWAs are supported by Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge browsers.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Next, let&#8217;s dig into these technologies that underlie PWAs and how they work.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do progressive web apps work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Progressive apps use the following key technologies:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Manifest:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manifest is a web app that provides developers with a central place for the metadata associated with a web application. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can include the web application\u2019s name, links to image objects and icons in the web app, the declaration for default orientation, the preferred URL to open or launch the web app, and more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When developers set and manipulate the metadata for the web manifest file, they enable the creation of a seamless mobile experience through the PWA, which functions like a native application.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Service workers:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Service workers are found between a user\u2019s device and the network, and supply content by providing a scriptable network proxy in the web browser that manages web\/HTTP requests programmatically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They efficiently use cache mechanisms to enable error-free behavior during offline periods. Further, they enable the PWA to synchronize <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data in the background, send out centralized updates, respond to the resource requests that originate elsewhere, and handle push notifications easily. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Application shell architecture<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some PWAs use the App Shell Model approach to allow for rapid loading. It involves service workers storing the basic user interface of a responsive web design which provides a static frame, layout, or architecture. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The content can be loaded into the App Shell Model progressively and dynamically. Users can then engage with the app even when web connectivity is waning.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So, what does all of this mean for your business&#8217;s bottom line?<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the benefits of progressive web apps?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Progressive web apps offer a number of benefits that businesses really can&#8217;t afford to miss. Here are some of the most impactful:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase mobile website reliability <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enable quick and seamless responses to user interactions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create an immersive and engaging user experience that feels like an app<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase convenience as users can keep apps they frequently use on their home screen<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lower the obstacles to use with no need for a complex installation<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easily share PWAs via a URL<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Re-engage users through push notifications<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engage users on all browsers and devices<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be discoverable via search engines<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easily keep your app up-to-date due to the service worker process<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure security as they are served via GTTPS<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Save your user&#8217;s storage space on their mobile devices&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do these benefits translate into increases in profitability?
