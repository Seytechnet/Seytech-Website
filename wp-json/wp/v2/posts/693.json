First things first, if you are debating between hiring an agency and a freelancer, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.brightscout.com\/should-i-hire-a-freelancer-or-agency-for-my-design-and-development-projects\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">read this<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Next, here are 5 critical things you should be looking for to get the best results:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-899\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/kwzwjtndplk.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\"><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Innovative Technology<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology is advancing every day. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.brightscout.com\/5-ways-bots-can-help-your-business-processes\/\">AI<\/a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.brightscout.com\/5-fintech-companies-using-blockchain-tech\/\">blockchain<\/a> are coming into their own and are opening a whole new world of possibilities. When building an app, taking advantage of the latest innovations enables you to expand its functionality, elongate its relevance, and gain a competitive advantage. However, to achieve these things, you&#8217;ll need a development partner that doesn\u2019t shy away from new technology. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Action Steps: To find out how innovative an agency is, ask them which technologies they incorporate into apps and if they have any new features they recommend. Also, look for case studies (like <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.brightscout.com\/grocery-enterprise-e-commerce\/\">this<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.brightscout.com\/future-group-messaging\/\">this<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.brightscout.com\/u-s-consumers-gravitate-to-digital-music-platforms\/\">this<\/a>) to see how their products meet the evolving needs of various industries.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. People-Centric Focus<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While tech is certainly a key factor in a successful app, it\u2019s equally important to gracefully serve the needs of the people you are targeting. When a developer is too focused on the tech side, they can easily lose sight of how certain factors are going to negatively impact the user experience.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Action Steps: To avoid this pitfall, you need a partner that listens to you, understands your target audience, and treats your project with care (not just like another transaction). Look for signs that the agency makes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;decisions and builds systems based on the people that will use them (i.e., asking detailed questions about your target audience, speaking of the importance of people in their work process, etc.).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Results-Oriented<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The &#8220;why&#8221; behind the app is where your return on investment lies. Being so, your partner should be focused on delivering the results you need through a great product. Further, they should be able to incorporate a way to show you your results. For example, they could offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.brightscout.com\/data-visualizations-can-boost-organizations-productivity\/\">data visualizations<\/a>&nbsp;that track app adoption, usage, or sales. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Action Steps: Look for a developer that shows a keen interest in your desired result and offers up solutions that help you track and achieve it. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Exquisite Design<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, we can\u2019t forget about the quality of the design. In fact, time and time again, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.brightscout.com\/white-paper-why-do-companies-with-good-design-outperform-companies-with-bad-design\/\">companies with good design outperform companies with bad design<\/a>, so this is key to your success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You need a team that understands design principles and has a track record of creating beautiful products. Further, they need to properly represent the brand and connect with the audience. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app&#8217;s functionality should be seamless, while the interface should be attractive and engaging.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Action Steps: Review a company&#8217;s past work and awards they have won for design.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Social Proof<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, a company can seem great but the proof is in the final product and what past clients say about it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Action Steps: Look for testimonials and reviews. You may even want to ask for references you can interview. Further, look through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/our-work.html\">work portfolio<\/a> and case studies to see if the work and reviews match up with a brand\u2019s messaging. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Total Package<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, here\u2019s what to look for when hiring an app development partner:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovative technology<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People-centric focus<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Results-oriented<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exquisite design<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social proof<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an app development partner delivers in all of these areas, they will likely be a good choice for your next project.
