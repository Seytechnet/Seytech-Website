The key is in the equipment attached to the drone which can include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High-resolution cameras to collect footage from current or potential project sites<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specialized viewers which enable you to see fine details<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other devices such as infrared filters or special sensors that detect gas leaks; providing multi-layered data<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This equipment enables drones to capture data which is seamlessly organized, put in context, and delivered to all relevant parties. The data is then instantly useful to organizations, and can also be used to improve AI, machine learning, and augmented intelligence. <\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_152\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-152\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-152 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Drone-Dashboard.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Drone-Dashboard.png 800w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Drone-Dashboard-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Drone-Dashboard-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Drone-Dashboard-510x382.png 510w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Drone-Dashboard-610x458.png 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Drone-Dashboard-600x450.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-152\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wow!
