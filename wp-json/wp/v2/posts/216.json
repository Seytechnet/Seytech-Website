We are seeing many changes, including a break from the status quo. Practices that were once considered \u201cweb-safe\u201d are no longer the only way. Further, advancing technology is increasing the creative freedom designers hold. Ready to see what\u2019s new? Here are the top 10 trends in web design this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Illustration Takes Center Stage<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Illustrations have come to the forefront of web design, helping to show the messages companies want to tell. They offer the unique benefit of being able to represent a diverse audience, while pho<\/span>tographs can quickly make parties feel excluded and think, \u201cThat\u2019s not for me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4216723-MyCalendar-Onboarding-No-3\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-178\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/dribbble1b.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, bespoke illustrations can be created to specifically match a company\u2019s tone and personality. They can help you stand out from your competition while adding an element of fun to your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4207609-Brames-Landing-Page\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-179\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/new.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider how illustrations can make your website more approachable and bring abstract concepts into vivid life in the coming year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borderless<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borderless design offers an alternative to the traditional approach where pages are broken up using various background colors and full-width images. Instead, a single background color stretches from the top to the bottom of the page and creates a seamless look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4081295-GitItBack-Landing-Page\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-185\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/lp-dbbb.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When using this design, the eye is guided down the page without any breaks. This works very well with responsive design because you don\u2019t have to worry about any background elements. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/3541638-Surge-Homepage-Designs\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-181\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/home_shot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/home_shot.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/home_shot-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/home_shot-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/home_shot-510x382.jpg 510w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/home_shot-610x458.jpg 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/home_shot-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you would like a clean and elegant feel to a web page, give borderless design a try. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isometric Illustrations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isometric illustrations are all over the web, and for good reason. They offer a unique perspective which communicates concepts and ideas easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4218167-Lender-Education-Of-Internet-Finance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-182\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/lender_education_of_internet_finance__0.5x.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These illustrations visually represent three-dimensional objects in two dimensions, which makes them great for technical illustrations, retro-inspired design, and city scenes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/3857702-Savagely-Landing-Page-Exploration\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-183\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/savagely_shot_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By integrating isometric illustrations into web design, you can help visitors more easily understand product functionality, can show depth, and create a more visually-appealing page. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bright and Brilliant<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Color is a beautiful thing, and this year, you will continue to see designers get more adventurous with the bright and brilliant shades they decide to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4216943-Dubai-Skyline-Illustration\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-186\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/dubai_skyline-800x600-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advances in technology have resulted in higher quality screen displays, such as smartphones with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">QHD resolutions, which are<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> capable of displaying increasingly vibrant colors. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4213239-Colorism\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-187\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/artboard_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These brighter colors can be used to instantly attract attention and differentiate a website from its competitors. Further, they give you more freedom in the creation process. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big Shadows<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up is big shadows. While shadows have been around for awhile, we are seeing them being used more and more. They can make an element more interesting while also creating an emphasis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4216006-Loopd-Homepage-Real-Project\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-188\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/d6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The flat design of the past is being left behind, as designers use depth to create the illusion of a world beyond the screen. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broken Grid<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broken grid shakes up symmetrical layouts with an unconventional, asymmetrical alternative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/3947322-Homepage-Design-for-E-Commerce-Website\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-189\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/1x-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the grid offers logic and harmony, it has become the status quo and is a bit constraining. The broken grid still uses concepts of the grid, but with some diversions. It allows images and text to enter into areas where the grid doesn\u2019t and lets elements overlap and converge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result is a page that still has order and flow but with a unique flair. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Text Heavy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past few years, many designers have minimized the amount of text on websites in favor of graphical elements. However, we have discovered people don\u2019t mind reading text if it tells a story and is easy on the eyes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/2170752-text-on-a-box\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-192\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/basc-home.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, that changes everything. Designers are now exploring custom fonts for headers and title text, and are using large text and spacing to turn words into art. Further, font weights and spacing are being used to create a rhythm to the text that guides the user throughout the narrative. Pages are being entirely composed of text with fewer visual graphics to compliment them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/3959535-Personal-Website-Update\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-191\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/personal_website_19-11-12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of fearing too much text, you\u2019ll see more designers letting the typography tell more of the story.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oblong Shapes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharp-edged cards with right angles have dominated web and mobile design for the past few years (Windows UI comes to mind).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4196573-dotCMS-Home-Page-Hero\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-193\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/showcase_1_dark.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But now we are seeing softer shapes with rounded corners and, notably, oblong shapes which have a cartoonish feel to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4112866-Sweet\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-180\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/sweet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/sweet.png 800w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/sweet-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/sweet-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/sweet-510x382.png 510w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/sweet-610x458.png 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/sweet-600x450.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2018, will continue to move toward softer, organic shapes with curved lines. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animated SVG<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animated SVG enables a new way to engage visitors when they visit a page. It can catch the eye of users, create a focal point or emphasize an element, and make your page more interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4062965-Optimize-ad-Animated-Hero\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-194\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/optimize-optimized.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where does animated SVG work best?

In case you haven\u2019t noticed, video is a trend still dominating the online world. It\u2019s no secret people prefer to watch videos and faster internet connections have made them more practical for websites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/4035374-A-Screen-Design-Tool-by-Framer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-196\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/dribbble.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through video, brands can effectively communicate a wealth of information within a small space and a short amount of time.
