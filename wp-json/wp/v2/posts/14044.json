It&#8217;s your brand identity&#8217;s primary visual representation, communicating everything someone needs to know about your brand in just a few symbols or letters.<\/p>\n<p>Trends change, but your logo should be your branding&#8217;s most consistent aspect. That&#8217;s why you must invest sufficient resources and time to come up with a perfect one.<\/p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s a crucial element of your brand message, not every entrepreneur knows what makes a terrific logo. A lot more goes into the design process than aesthetics. A logo should consider the audience, brand voice, company mission, culture, values, and other branding aspects. But when done wrong, it could be an immense liability to your organization.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14046\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Design-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Graphic designer drawing sketch design creative Ideas drafting AI logo designs.\" width=\"1254\" height=\"836\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Design-logo.jpg 1254w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Design-logo-980x653.jpg 980w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Design-logo-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1254px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>What Makes a Great AI Logo?<\/h2>\n<p>A logo is central to your branding and serves as the first point of contact with potential customers and partners. So when designing one, you must make sure the final product represents your brand perfectly, and the relevant consumers can relate to it.<\/p>\n<p>Logo designs are versatile, but you must pay attention to several outstanding elements that form a great logo. Generally, awesome AI logo designs must fulfill the following:<\/p>\n<h3>Simplicity<\/h3>\n<p>Over\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.studyfinds.org\/brand-awareness-survey-ranks-top-30-most-recognizable-logos-in-the-u-s\/\">50 percent of consumers<\/a>\u00a0will go for a brand with a recognizable logo, and a simple, recognizable logo can help you become the brand. A simple branding will showcase your company mission and message through visual strength, allowing consumers to discern your brand quickly and make a purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>Memorability<\/h3>\n<p>Excellent AI logo designs can foster success through a memorable brand identity that will stand out in consumers&#8217; minds whenever they&#8217;re out shopping. Consistent and unique brand presentations can significantly boost your revenue. Since people can process pictures <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emailaudience.com\/research-picture-worth-1000-words-marketing\/\">60,000 times faster<\/a>\u00a0than words, detailed symbols enhance brand recognition. So make sure you choose excellent colors for the best first impression and brand recognition.<\/p>\n<h3>Timelessness<\/h3>\n<p>A brand is how consumers view your organization, not what you decide it to be. Understandably, some logo designs miss the mark, and rebranding is always a great option to fix this. However, designing a classic logo that can stand the test of time will work in your favor. This is particularly crucial since\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/onbrand.me\/state-of-branding-report-2017\/#subscribe\">70% of brand managers<\/a>\u00a0acknowledge the importance of nurturing a regular audience.<\/p>\n<h3>Versatility<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s imperative to have a versatile logo design in the current age of mobile devices and social media. Today&#8217;s consumers prefer a consistent cross-platform experience, so you must brand all your mediums. Unfortunately, not every design is ideal for email campaigns, content marketing, and smartphone screens. That&#8217;s why you should go for a responsive design versatile enough to fit every marketing medium and screen.<\/p>\n<h3>On-Brand<\/h3>\n<p>A consumer needs only seven seconds to develop a brand&#8217;s first impression. So you have one shot at communicating your brand message in a single image. Begin with comprehensive research before commencing with the logo design. Understand your demographic and pick an overarching goal. These insights will inform your branding and ensure an appropriate logo on-brand with your products, services, and message.<\/p>\n<h2>Overview of our Top AI Logos of 2021<\/h2>\n<p>Share your brand message and show off its personality with a quality custom AI logo designed for your company by a professional designer.

However, it also contains other shades, including Twink Teal, Wink White, Blink Blue, and Dusk Dark.<\/p>\n<p>This futuristic logo best fits the organization that takes pride in maintaining continuous cloud reliability while paying attention to innovation velocity.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14067\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.15.36-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"928\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.15.36-AM.png 928w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.15.36-AM-480x298.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 928px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Grouped<\/h3>\n<p>At first look, the Grouped logo may seem like the letter G, probably representing the brand name. But after a closer look, you&#8217;ll notice that the imagery imitates the shape of a clasped fist held in the air.<\/p>\n<p>This bold symbol effortlessly conveys the group and social communication platform&#8217;s services and values with simplicity and modernity. Notably, the site maintains the same theme in almost every section, which appears as a rounded shape with three dots. This logo design and website interface consistency significantly boosts the logo&#8217;s memorability.<\/p>\n<p>The logo also has some animation elements, drawing the viewers&#8217; eyes and holding their interest.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14066\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-8.17.47-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"549\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-8.17.47-AM.png 915w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-8.17.47-AM-480x288.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 915px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Predibase<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to use your brand name on the logo and be playful with it, as evident in this Predibase logo. The simple and minimalistic logo design aligns with the fundamental principles of a memorable brand.<\/p>\n<p>Based on this design, it&#8217;s easy for consumers already familiar with this brand to identify it at a glance. As such, they&#8217;ll likely consider it when looking for an effective AI solution that combines the capabilities of the predictive query language, machine learning, and automated serving.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14063\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.08.45-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"939\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.08.45-AM.png 939w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.08.45-AM-480x251.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 939px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Peep<\/h3>\n<p>The minimalistic and straightforward Peep logo can be considered a form of inventive typography or wordmark. Our designer used the brand name (lettering and text) by styling it uniquely to use the brand name as the service mark.<\/p>\n<p>The most significant benefit of this logo design is that you can use the most superficial font standards to design the most obscure concepts for your brand image. So be creative when coming up with yours, but remember to keep it easy to perceive and legible in consumers&#8217; eyes.<\/p>\n<p>The design uses a blue color that gives the business appointments and bookings platform the impression of optimism and reliability.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14065\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-8.18.32-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"914\" height=\"572\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-8.18.32-AM.png 914w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-8.18.32-AM-480x300.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 914px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Phylum<\/h3>\n<p>Vivid lines, imagery, and fonts are critical when designing modern logos, and Phylum is a perfect example. The icon comprises a five-circle grid with an abstract, current version of the finch. Furthermore, the grid displays harmony and cohesively blends different circles and colors.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s futuristic logo design aligns with the brand&#8217;s perception as the future of software supply chain protection. It&#8217;s sufficiently versatile and can fit different browsers and smartphone screens.<\/p>\n<p>Such stunning logos that combine the primary color (blue) with different shades usually send a strong message that plain primary-colored logos are a thing of the past.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14068\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.24.19-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"734\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.24.19-AM.png 734w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.24.19-AM-480x309.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 734px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Glimpse.ai<\/h3>\n<p>The Glimpse.ai logo uses a maximum of two colors (blue and black), symmetry, and negative space to create a modern logo that portrays the brand as an industry leader in using AI to deliver clever and intelligent user experiences to customers.<\/p>\n<p>The logo is creative and scalable, and it can fit a book cover, phone screen, browser page, or billboard and still be visible and easily recognizable. The artistic expression, negative space, and playfulness also work well with this remarkable logo design. Ensure you don&#8217;t go beyond two bold colors if you wish to adopt a similar design.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14062\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.09.11-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"527\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.09.11-AM.png 936w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-10.09.11-AM-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 936px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>The Shift to AI Logo Designs<\/h2>\n<p>Qualified AI logo designers are transforming the face of logo creation, helping organizations of all sizes and sectors deliver their brand messages in the best way possible. <strong>Here are the main benefits of BrightScout&#8217;s revolutionary approach:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A quick process<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Unless you&#8217;re a design expert, it&#8217;ll take you longer to settle on a specific logo to represent your brand.
