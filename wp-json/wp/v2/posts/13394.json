These include Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. All these companies are aggressively investing in AI technology. On the other hand, one of the emerging dominant trends in customer service is AI customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>Note that good customer experiences help people to appreciate a brand or a purchase more. In turn, the positive experience encourages buyers to make repeat purchases. So, if you want to turn a first-time customer into a long-term advocate and loyalist, you should prioritize offering a more personalized and efficient experience.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, here are some\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/artificial-intelligence-statistics\/\">important AI statistics<\/a>\u00a0you cannot ignore.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022By 2025, the global AI-driven hardware market revenue is foreseen to grow to $234.6 billion.<br \/>\n\u2022AI contribution to the global economy by 2030 is projected to be $15.7 trillion.<br \/>\n\u202280% of business executives claim that their entities will have adopted AI technology by 2027. That means that the retail sector will probably experience significant growth when that happens.<br \/>\n\u2022By 2027, the expectation is that the AI industry market size will be worth $266.92 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Understand that conventional enterprises are currently competing against innovative, digital-native upstarts. That is the case since the latter has grown customer bases by prioritizing customer experience. The bottom line here is that offering an exceptional customer experience is not an option. That explains why consumer-facing firms across industries are using Artificial Intelligence to enhance user experience.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence in Web Design\/Development<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Presently, having a website has become mandatory for all business niches in the market. AI comes in handy, in this case, because it plays an important role in reshaping web design and development. For that reason, most web development organizations are now developing AI-enabled sites.<\/p>\n<p>Note that for most customers, web design and user-friendly site interfaces determine the credibility of a particular business. In simple terms, AI has become an indispensable part of web development for various reasons, including;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Promoting Marketing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>AI applies Machine Learning in web design\/development, and the collaboration of the two helps make marketing predictions. That, in turn, avails useful insights like the ideal time for a buyer to shop, the things customers intend to purchase next, the mediums and devices clients use when browsing your website, the products that customers like, among other things.<\/p>\n<p>These details bridge the gap between consumers and businesses to yield better results and increase an entity&#8217;s ROI.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Availing Better Reply Predictions<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Increasing business sales through better reply predictions is the primary objective behind using AI in chatbots. The reason is that chatbots predict the correct responses and reactions to queries from users. Multi-factor authentication, data encryption, and behavior analysis are some of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/see-how-ai-is-changing-the-world-around-us\/\">AI techniques<\/a>\u00a0that power chatbot communication with utmost security.<\/p>\n<p>AI can also be used to develop web-enabled devices or advanced sites to connect technology with human behavior.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence in App Development<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>First, understand that AI app development takes data scientists, software engineers, and the collective effort of other experts to ensure that the finished product is truly innovative, cost-effective, and customer-centric. AI app development has several benefits. For example, it improves customer analytics and the prediction of customer behavior.<\/p>\n<p>That is possible due to effective management of vast data amounts and high-quality, adaptable learning models, allowing entities to make research deep and comprehensive while reducing cost. AI-powered consumer analytics;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Improve ad personalization, which promotes sales and customer satisfaction.<br \/>\n\u2022Study consumer behavior patterns carefully and ensure their future prediction accuracy by adjusting sales and marketing policies.<br \/>\n\u2022Enhance the level of personalization of offers using precise targeting based on ML models. AI-powered consumer analytics will also offer high-quality, relevant product recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>Access to higher security is the other reason why AI app development is becoming popular. Cybercrime is on the rise, which suggests that the safety of money and data is becoming a concern among users of digital products. AI systems provide data loss prevention tools and fast and secure multi-factor authentication, which gives them an upper hand in fighting cyberattacks.<\/p>\n<p>Other benefits of AI app development include;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022Reducing the risks associated with human error.<br \/>\n\u2022Improving the overall performance of an application.<br \/>\n\u2022Facilitating effective integration with IoT devices.<br \/>\n\u2022Improving user experience continuously through self-learning models.<br \/>\n\u2022Optimizing customer searches with voice assistants, hints, and spelling corrections.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-13396\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/AI-improves-customer-experience.jpg\" alt=\"artificial-intelligence-pointing-to-icons-in-a-blue-background\" width=\"1341\" height=\"782\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/AI-improves-customer-experience.jpg 1341w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/AI-improves-customer-experience-1280x746.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/AI-improves-customer-experience-980x571.jpg 980w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/AI-improves-customer-experience-480x280.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1341px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Artificial Intelligence Improves Customer Experience<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>AI customer experience refers to a holistic view of how\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/cognitiveworld\/2020\/05\/07\/how-are-companies-using-ai-to-enhance-the-customer-experience\/?sh=22b0e4e64095\">customer experience<\/a>\u00a0is augmented by artificial intelligence. Note that AI customer experience leverages technology like natural language understanding (NLU), machine learning (ML), and deep learning to automate various interactions that make up a user&#8217;s experience.<\/p>\n<p>AI customer experience differs from AI customer service in that the former goes beyond rapid resolutions to customer issues and questions. AI can improve customer experience in multiple ways, and here are some of them.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. It Personalizes Customer Experience<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Today, AI is helping customers streamline their online experience and discover the most relevant products. The reason is that the probability of consumers buying from a brand that provides personalized experiences is relatively high. A characteristic example is using AI as a recommendation tool, which is what Netflix and Amazon do best by basing consumer recommendations on user behavior.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix AI scans huge amounts of data to present a different home screen to each viewer, allowing customers to quickly find something they want to watch. These recommendations are based on granular audience segmentation and past viewing behavior. Another example of a personalized search that enhances customer experience is online shopping.<\/p>\n<p>That is why eCommerce companies are using AI to present highly relevant products from massive online catalogs. AI-powered search eliminates the need to scroll through multiple pages to view a few products that one may be interested in, which yields a better user experience.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Facilitates 24\/7 Support Across Various Channels<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Customers expect to receive customer support on multiple channels. Managing such channels around the clock using human-only agent teams is not only\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/how-facebooks-ai-is-training-home-robots-to-tackle-the-chores-you-hate\/\">a daunting task<\/a>\u00a0but is also expensive. Scaling support across voice, email, SMS, chat, and messaging platforms is possible through AI. That way, customers can access the support they need on the channels they prefer.<\/p>\n<p>So, delivering a truly omnichannel experience that consumers expect without AI would be cost-prohibitive.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Creates Hyper-Relevant Digital Ads<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It is quite unfortunate to discover that ads are often irrelevant, which is why most people ignore them. As much as that is the case, advertisements are here to stay, and the experience is ripe for change. As such, brands are harnessing AI to show hyper-relevant ads, which addresses the challenges with digital ads and makes them less intrusive.<\/p>\n<p>That means that companies can anticipate if an individual is likely to click on an ad based on audience segmentation, online behavior, and customer profiling, thanks to machine learning. For instance, firms can adapt ads to an individual customer and recommend ads based on thousands of signals through predictive targeting.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, these algorithms improve to provide ads that are increasingly personalized.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Anticipates and Prevents Issues<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/louiscolumbus\/2020\/04\/29\/six-areas-where-ai-is-improving-customer-experiences\/?sh=5f12888f3f5b\">AI comes in handy<\/a>\u00a0in proactive customer service. That allows organizations to anticipate and address issues and problems before customers even get to know about them. Proactively educating a person on how to care for a product, alerting a customer when a package will be arriving late due to bad weather, or offering early check-in to a client whose flight has arrived early, are examples of where AI is applicable.<\/p>\n<p>Also, HP is one of the companies that help customers plan in good time. For example, HP alerts consumers when their printer ink is almost running low and provides a friction-free way to reorder compatible ink. That, in turn, eliminates user frustration and improves the responses submitted during customer satisfaction surveys and customer effort scores.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, a client will not need to reach out to a particular entity to resolve underlying issues when AI is leveraged in this way.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Helps Customers Find The Best Price<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>AI ensures customers are confident that they are getting the best possible price. That is possible through predictive intelligence around price fluctuations. For instance, Hopper is one of the highly-esteemed startups in the travel industry that heavily relies on AI to provide an exceptional customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>The organization &#8220;offers travelers flight recommendations based on highly accurate pricing predictions while uncovering price cuts and exclusive deals that are relevant to travelers.&#8221; Another option that improves customer experience is using an AI travel chatbot to quickly respond to questions and resolve problems.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that AI is not the job killer that workers were once worried about, neither is it the boogie man that sci-fi movies scared people with in the past. Using AI chatbots to engage the customer, understand consumers better, provide a hyper-personalized experience, and leverage predictive analysis and real-time decision-making can improve the customer journey through all touchpoints and across all channels.<\/p>\n<p>You also need to understand that Artificial Intelligence for customer experience is not just about consumer satisfaction; it also improves your returns.
