While the segment is small compared to those shopping in brick-and-mortar stores, it is growing fast. In 2012, online grocery sales were around $6 billion, they reached $14.2 billion in 2017, and are predicted to reach $29.7 billion by 2021. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And who is doing most of the online grocery shopping?

As of 2016, Amazon\u2019s online grocery shopping services, AmazonFresh and PrimePantry, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/1915\/us-consumers-online-grocery-shopping\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held the majority of the market share<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; approximately <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-led-us-online-grocery-2017-2018-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">18%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Wal-Mart trailed behind in second place with about 9% market share. Companies are taking notice of the growing trend and seizing the opportunity. For example, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and the Kroeger Company issued mandates to invest in technology for home delivery services and keeping produce fresh. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, last year, both Costco and Wal-Mart tested new home delivery programs, with Costco aiming to offer the service in 50 markets by the end of the year. And, a smaller company, Aldi, made an interesting move by partnering with independent grocery delivery service InstaCart to introduce home deliveries in three markets. However, Amazon isn\u2019t sitting idly letting its competitors attempt to pass it by. It made a big move acquiring Whole Foods last year, which instantly boosted it\u2019s online grocery sales and further positioned it as a main player in the grocery market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-165\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/trending-1024x585.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/trending-1024x585.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/trending-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/trending-768x439.png 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/trending-1080x617.png 1080w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/trending-610x349.png 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/trending-600x343.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b><i>As online services like AmazonFresh, Walmart, and Instacart continue to become more popular, traditional grocery brands will need to evolve and innovate their e-commerce solutions or will die.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grocery Store E-commerce Made Easy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if there was an enterprise e-commerce platform for grocery stores that locations could install and set up in days, and not months? A flexible open source platform that you could choose to host in the cloud or install on your own infrastructure. One that was completely scalable and configurable so you could take on the big guys. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first component is a customer-facing mobile application for shopping. The interface lists all of a store\u2019s available products, organized for easy viewing by customers. Further, it features recipes so customers can do all their meal planning and shopping simultaneously; saving them time and encouraging larger orders.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_166\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-166\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-166\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/main-screen-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/main-screen-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/main-screen-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/main-screen-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/main-screen-510x382.jpg 510w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/main-screen-1080x810.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/main-screen-610x458.jpg 610w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/main-screen-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/main-screen.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">No more half day marathons at the grocery store.

Members of the organization can be authorized to log in and review information such as the location of drivers, reviews from customers, average delivery times, contact numbers, new customers, gross profits, completed orders, and more.

The level of convenience without much of an increase in price is hard to compete with, especially amidst the busy lifestyles of the American people. And the evolution doesn\u2019t end with online groceries. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Various other technologies are emerging. For example, Amazon launched a pilot store this year, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/610006\/amazons-checkout-free-grocery-store-is-opening-to-the-public\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AmazonGo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with no check out clerks or counters. You simply grab what you want and go. How does that work? It\u2019s quite complex, involving a combination of a smartphone app, machine learning, computer-vision algorithms, and hundreds of incognito infrared and regular cameras. When you walk out, your credit card is automatically charged for the items you chose. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/kroger-is-rolling-out-digital-shelf-technology-2018-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kroger<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is also rolling out new technology this year in 200 of its stores. It will install digital displays where price tags normally hang which can display the price, nutritional information, ads, and more. One of the earliest potential benefits they\u2019ve identified is the ability for smartphones to pair with displays, enabling the display to light up when an item is on your shopping list. This was tested out when preparing online orders, and it drastically cut down the packing time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grocery shopping in ten, five, and even as little as three, years is going to be very different than it is today due to technology. A large market is up for grabs. The question is, how will companies respond and which will make it to the other side?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meet Brightscout<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team at Brightscout specializes in building innovative technology solutions for enterprises.
