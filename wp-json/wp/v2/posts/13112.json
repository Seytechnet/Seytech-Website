Let&#8217;s have a look at the importance of digital transformation, the pitfalls to avoid when developing your next big enterprise app, and things to do before, during, and after the development process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is Digital Transformation, and Why is it Important?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Digital transformation is the application of technology to revolutionize your business&#8217; operations. It&#8217;s an opportunity to reinvent business processes, organizational culture, and customer experiences to deliver value and cope with dynamic market requirements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Customers&#8217; and employees&#8217; mindsets are evolving thanks to emerging and changing technologies. Therefore, robust digital solutions are a necessity. Integration of these products across your business allows them to seamlessly access data and processes. The result is business growth and protection of your competitive edge.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Here are a few benefits of digital transformation:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Enriched client experience: the transformation enhances easy, fast, and valuable solutions to their problems. With digital platforms, you gather feedback, engage in target marketing, and resolve complaints.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Data-based insights: with digital transformation, you enjoy transparent and accurate metrics tracking. You need the data for optimization of operations and strategize your next action.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Reduced costs and better profits: these are the ultimate advantages. Digitization boosts sales and improves savings by phasing out slow and error-prone manual interventions.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Better innovation and agility: it supports innovative and agile ways of meeting customer needs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Improved market penetration: you gain more clients as you penetrate new markets. As such, your customer base and loyalty increase.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Informed decision making: sufficient data facilitates informed strategies. The customer is the king. Digital transformation aims at understanding the clients&#8217; behavior and needs. The executives can use the feedback to create an exact fit for them.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What Are the Pitfalls of Enterprise App Development?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Are you looking to create a robust enterprise mobile app? Your chances of success will increase if you do things right from the get-go. Give your users a listening ear, test your product, deliver excellent UI and UX, and obtain buy-in from the executive team on digital transformation benefits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some common pitfalls when building enterprise applications tend to haunt businesses during this crucial initiative. Let&#8217;s discuss them to help you know their nature, avoid them, and build a product that stands out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Development of Too Many Features<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It&#8217;s tempting to think that customers will embrace all the features you throw into the application. But the truth is that this action only increases cumbersomeness. You&#8217;ll have to spend more time and money to develop it. After releasing it, negative feedback about slow performance will start pouring in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Quality is better than quantity. Therefore, it&#8217;s crucial to stick with essential and unique functions that will meet or exceed customers&#8217; expectations. Then, you can upgrade the application with extra features based on customer feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Setting an Unrealistic Budget<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Let&#8217;s face it, tailoring an app to serve a particular organization can be expensive. It requires highly-skilled designers, developers, marketing personnel, and other experts. The process can also go up to several months for complex requirements of functionalities and features.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Technologies like Virtual Reality (VR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Augmented Reality (AR) are continuing to shape the mobile industry each year. These changes mean more complications and requirements regarding time and resources.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Proper planning up to the cent is necessary. You&#8217;ll need to discuss requirements and assess the overall budget with contractors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ignoring the Impact Good Design Can Have on Adoption and Engagement<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Trying to force your website to fit a mobile environment only leads to poor UX and UI. Failure to develop your mobile strategy before building a mobile app leads to a product that isn&#8217;t intuitive. Your audience will shy away from switching to the new app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Focus on developing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that supports mobile devices. Additionally, remember to bring in an experienced design team that understands their trade regarding UX, UI, and mobile app design.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Insufficient Testing &#8211; Building Something Nobody Wants<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Without proper testing, your released app may not serve the intended purpose or crash when traffic increases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A poorly-developed app leads to frustration among employees, leading to low morale. And for external customers, negative reviews, negative brand image, and loss of users can ensue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Test your application&#8217;s back-end before releasing it. Do you lack the necessary skills? Hire a quality assurance team that knows its trade inside out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Failing to Build a Marketing Strategy<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The app stores are already awash with many apps. And many more are continuing to pour in daily. That means stiff competition. So a poor app marketing strategy cannot cut it. It&#8217;s critical to remember the competition when building enterprise applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Therefore, think about marketing before investing your time, money, and efforts. Conduct market research, optimize your app page, market it in social media, build reviews and testimonials, and promote the app through influencers. Be sure to explain the advantages and working of the app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Not Building a Cohesive Style Between the Brand and the Product<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lack of brand cohesiveness across your apps and digital media denies your business a chance to cement its recognition, boost trust, and strengthen brand identity. Furthermore, your brand will fail to create a memorable experience among your audience, leading to lost conversions and opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So don&#8217;t stop at just slapping a cool logo on your app page. If you&#8217;re looking to stand out from the cut-throat competition, it&#8217;s time to improve style cohesiveness between your app and brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Carefully choose your style regarding graphics, fonts, illustrations, tone of voice, and colors. Then remain consistent with them on your application, website, social media platforms, and other marketing materials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13114\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/coding-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"building enterprise application\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/coding-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/coding-980x653.jpg 980w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/coding-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Building Too Many Platforms, or the Wrong Platforms<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Developing and building enterprise applications on every platform you think of can be tempting. After all, who doesn&#8217;t want to reach as many users as possible?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But your app will most definitely require modification once users begin interacting with it. As users&#8217; feedback starts rolling in, you&#8217;ll learn a lot regarding their behavior. The customer is king, right? So you may have to change, add, modify, or remove the app&#8217;s features to make it fit in with the customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s better to focus on one or a few platforms, enrich the app based on user feedback, then branch out to others. That way, you won&#8217;t spend too much money or time attempting to modify the product for every platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ignoring Bad Feedback<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Let&#8217;s face it, pleasing everyone is impossible. You&#8217;ll likely get several negative reviews on the app page and elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But the main push for improvements lies in this feedback. And anyone&#8217;s review may represent the views of a thousand others who feel the same but remain silent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Offer a listening ear to those one-star reviews that come with long, complaining paragraphs. Respond to them, change the app where necessary, or validate any decision if you&#8217;re looking to win these customers. That way, it shows you value their time and feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Putting It Together<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As seen above, the pitfalls when building enterprise applications translate to embarrassment and loss of the organization&#8217;s resources. The ripple effect is the loss of potential and existing customers, plus a negative brand image.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Restoring your public image can be a hard nut to crack in this digital age. So be sure to get it right using these tips:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before Development<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Define your application&#8217;s scope<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Research its usability<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Decide on its architecture<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Work on developing great UI and UX<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Avoid features overload<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Choose a product owner to manage the development of the app<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Introduce the world of digital transformation to your employees and be sure they grasp its importance to the company<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Only concentrate on transforming a process at the time<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">During Development<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Test your product with real users and quality assurance team<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Start marketing way before completion of marketing<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Be sure your solution can accommodate the required number of new users<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before adding new features, be sure the initial ones are working as intended.
