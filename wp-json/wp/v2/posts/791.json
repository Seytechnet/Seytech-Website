There could be no more of a frustrating user experience for an app that claims it&#8217;s going to find your next &#8220;true love&#8221;. Therefore, in order for your app to be successful, you&#8217;ll need to be very strategic how you role out your app. Make sure not to unlock regions until they are populated with eager users.<\/p>\n<h3>Leverage Large Groupings of People<\/h3>\n<p>Populating your app with a mass audience is expensive. Therefore it&#8217;s important to get the most for your ad dollars. It&#8217;s no coincidence that almost every popular dating app has been grown out of college campuses. Not only do you have a willing customer base, you also have a concentrated community of like-minded individuals. By concentrating your efforts to&nbsp;places with a high population density such as colleges and events like large concerts. You can touch and remarket to users at a fraction of the cost.<\/p>\n<h3>Build a &#8220;Dating&#8221; App, not a &#8220;Matching&#8221; App<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it, dating apps have failed in their mission. There very good a matching you with another person you&#8217;ll most likely hit it off with. However, there actually really horrible at getting you off your couch or your little personal bubble to meet other people. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re calling out all dating apps and future dating apps to widen there focus. To fulfill your mission, you need to do more than let people swipe left or right. It&#8217;s your duty to make actual meaningful connections between two individuals.<\/p>\n<p>Our bet is, the app that understands the date is the product and not the app or match will win. This will mean focusing on creating the best experiences outside the app; not within.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hire Brightscout: Unlock your app\u2019s hidden revenue<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online dating is a growing industry with room for innovation.
