To meet this growing demand, Slack created a digital workspace back in 2013 for private and group messaging, sharing files, and integrating third-party programs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While helpful in many ways, it falls short of serving all of the needs of an enterprise, even with their Enterprise Grid offering. That\u2019s where the open source, private-cloud messaging platform Mattermost comes in to fill the gap. Mattermost is designed specifically for enterprises and offers all that Slack does and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a look at Slack vs. Mattermost, and how to figure out which is best for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack (an acronym for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge) <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the cloud-based, Software-as-a-Service messaging system made to help organizations communicate online. &nbsp;It keeps a searchable archive of all conversations, allows for sharing files and integrating apps, and has an open API so developers can build new apps for it.

Further, it\u2019s not ideal for those looking to scale the messaging solution significantly or deeply integrate it into their existing systems. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let\u2019s take a look at the Slack-alternative, Mattermost. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mattermost<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mattermost, Inc. provides messaging solutions specifically designed for enterprises and aims to be the primary way people communicate with enterprises and applications.

Here\u2019s why. You can deploy it wherever you want; on public, private, or hybrid clouds. Install it behind your firewall in an environment with security parameters you trust. You won\u2019t have to worry about SaaS services learning about your business matters or activities. Further, this setup also simplifies compliance with laws and regulations such as consumer data protection and GDPR. Tesla Motors recently replaced Slack with Mattermost for its team of over 2,000 developers due to these very reasons; more privacy, private cloud security, and enterprise licensing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mattermost solutions can also effectively scale and deeply integrate to specific use cases. &nbsp;Enterprises gain access to source code, APIs, drivers, open source integrations, samples, and more, giving them complete control to customize the platform as they see fit. Further, the single-tenant private cloud architecture offers horizontal scaling and high availability. Take, for example, the Uber case. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company needed a new internal chat solution because its previous one was crashing and couldn\u2019t keep up with the company\u2019s growth. After testing many different options, Uber chose to build on Mattermost due to its scalability and redundancy, customization, privacy, and enterprise licensing. The new and improved solution supports 32,000 users and over 700,000 messages per day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last point to note is that Mattermost gives you control and ownership over your data on the application itself including chat conversations, files shared, and all other content. Never worry about being paywalled out of your data.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Verdict: Slack or Mattermost<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The right messaging solution for your business really comes down to your specific needs and preferences.Small-scale operations that want an out-of-the-box solution may find Slack suitable for their needs, specifically if they aren\u2019t sharing sensitive material. Further, some enterprises may find the Enterprise Grid to work for them. However, if your business is concerned about owning the content shared in communications, keeping it secure and private, and being able to scale and configure it as you grow, there\u2019s no question; Mattermost is the way to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019d like help integrating Mattermost into your business, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/contact\/\">contact our experts<\/a> today. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In today\u2019s digital world, the ability for businesses to connect and collaborate in an online environment has become a necessity.
