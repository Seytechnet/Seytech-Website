They have embraced the reality that they&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no longer have to physically go to the store, find a CD, wait in line, and pay $10 to $20 for it. Instead, they can simply download a song or album online with a click of a button. Further, they can pay around $10 per month to stream all the albums they want. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a closer look at this shift and how you can build stunning digital products to serve the new music market. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift to digital music platforms<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in 2008, U.S. digital music revenue totaled about $2.6 billion and was primarily generated from ringtones and ringbacks, album downloads, single downloads, and music video downloads. Then came 2011, when the subscription and streaming model caught on. Within three years, it surpassed all other sources of digital music revenue.

What is the main driving factor of this growth? You guessed it, music streaming subscriptions.

They accounted for $1.3 billion in revenue and 15% of the total music industry revenue. Further, revenues from physical products decreased by 4%, accounting for $1.5 billion in revenue and 17% of total revenue. Synchronization royalties also made a small appearance, attributing 3% of the industry\u2019s revenue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-407\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screen-Shot-2018-04-03-at-1.26.14-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"564\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screen-Shot-2018-04-03-at-1.26.14-PM.png 564w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screen-Shot-2018-04-03-at-1.26.14-PM-300x223.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s interesting that physical products outperformed digital downloads as this is the first occurrence since 2011. However, it is the result of the steep 25% decrease in digital downloads. If consumers are going to purchase digital music, the subscription format offers more value. Many seem to agree as the only source of revenue showing sizeable growth is the one for streaming services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-406\" style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screen-Shot-2018-04-03-at-12.53.13-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screen-Shot-2018-04-03-at-12.53.13-PM.png 367w, https:\/\/www.brightscout.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Screen-Shot-2018-04-03-at-12.53.13-PM-300x249.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating beautiful digital music platforms<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this drastic shift, comes the opportunity for businesses to provide listeners with the digital music platforms they want.
